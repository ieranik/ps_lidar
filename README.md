# Pseudo-LIDAR with SFA3D

In this project, we implement a novel pipeline for 3D object detection from stereo images using the [Pseudo-LIDAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07179) framework. The basic Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline takes as input a pair of images and uses a stereo depth estimation network to compute the depth map. Then the depths of the pixels are back-projected in the 3D space to create a point cloud, which is called Pseudo-LiDAR. Finally, a 3D object detection model is employed to identify the 3D objects in the Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud.

A key characteristic of both Pseudo-LiDAR is that any existing stereo depth estimation model and object detection model can be incorporated into the pipeline. In the original version, Pseudo-LiDAR used the state-of-the-art depth estimator, [PSM-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08669), and the then best-performing object detectors, [AVOD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02294), for object detection.

In this project, we integrate a more recent and efficient 3D object detector, called [SFA3D](https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D), into the pseudo-LIDAR pipeline. We test the performance on the [KITTI dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6248074). Our initial findings suggest that the integration of SFA3D reduces the number of false negatives compared to the existing pseudo-LIDAR variants. This repository contains a partial implementation of our code. The code for SFA3D is forked from this [repo](https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D). The full code will be released upon completion of the project.
